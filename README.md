As of yet, it relies on two external JS libraries:
* <a href="https://github.com/oampo/Audiolet">Audiolet</a> (by <a href="https://github.com/oampo">oampo</a>) for synthesis of tones
* <a href="https://github.com/0xfe/vexflow">vexflow</a> (by <a href="https://github.com/0xfe">0xfe"</a>) for notation

Licenses for those specific libraries can be found within their submodule folders.
